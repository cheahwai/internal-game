upgrade/correction from grand demo
- laser usage still not consistance
- autopiling lagori (analog sensor, imu)
  -> maybe use pp/other to position the robot near the fance, then use two analog sensor to correct
  -> try near to the base and not bang to fance
  -> how to make sure that the robot is normal to the normal (another sensor is needed)
- motors
  -> use other motor with high torque for lagori piling (pw slow and easy fuck up - 2 aready die)
      - faulfabaur, vesc?
- machanism wise
  -> 3d print of ball gripper may broken
  -> slider is not smooth enought (cann't go up smoothly)
  -> the pulley rope easily come out (may be is because the gripper is blocked by something cause it cannot go down
                while the pulley is going down)
  -> bending at lagori gripper
  -> weight
  -> ball gripper servo (look vilation at fance when see the robot at other angle
- programming wise
  -> bug
      - after sucess lagori grip, it will auto move up one more layer (lagori size 4 go to level 3)
      - laser still not straight high chance bank the R1
      - navi >> sometime will helicopter during start of lagori piling (check back the realMODN code)
             >> sometime will not go back when pull down ps4.joyL_y
  -> advise/ ideas that havent added in
      - use PB1, PB2 to initiate the position of servos instate of using ps4 and button f(x)
      - remember to derminate the task that handling process ps4 data (lagoritask for seeker and autonomous for hitter)
      - may try seperate 4 path into several path containing 1 point each
      - combine release lagori and move back into 1 button (SQUARE)
      - try DMA UART Rx for recieve datas from RVIZ
